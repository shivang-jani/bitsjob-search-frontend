About This App
Welcome! This app is a modern, full-stack web project built to show how powerful and easy it can be to develop and deploy cloud-based applications using popular technologies. It's a blend of performance, scalability, and clean architecture.

💡
The Idea
We wanted to create a real-world full-stack application using widely-used tools — not just as a demo, but as a foundation for scalable and maintainable projects.

The goals were simple:

✅
Build with React for a fast, responsive UI
✅
Use Spring Boot for solid backend logic and REST APIs
✅
Store data in MongoDB Atlas, a flexible, cloud-hosted NoSQL database
✅
Host everything with modern deployment tools (Vercel + Render)
🛠️
How We Built It
🎨
Frontend — React + Vercel
The frontend is built with React, styled with modern CSS, and deployed to Vercel for fast global delivery and auto-deployment on every push.

⚙️
Backend — Spring Boot + Render
The backend uses Spring Boot, exposing secure and scalable REST APIs. We host it on Render, which handles deployment directly from our GitHub repo.

🗄️
Database — MongoDB Atlas
Data is stored in MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted NoSQL solution that's reliable, flexible, and integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot.

🔄
CI/CD — GitHub Integration
Everything is version-controlled on GitHub, and both Vercel and Render are set to auto-deploy changes on every commit. No manual deploys needed!

🎯
Why We Built It
This project is more than a tech demo — it's a reference architecture for building real apps. Whether you're launching a startup, learning full-stack development, or experimenting with cloud tools, this setup gives you a solid starting point.

🚀
What's Next?
We've laid the foundation — now it's time to build on it! Here's what's coming up:

📝
Make the "Apply" button functional
Users will soon be able to apply for jobs, triggering backend workflows and saving their submissions to the database.

📩
Send email alerts
Automatically notify users via email when a new job matching their interests is posted.

👋
User onboarding & offboarding
Smooth experiences for both new and departing users, with personalized welcome flows and account cleanup.

📣
